This was a project I did in 2019 with Dr. Burt using HARPS and PFS data. TheTransiting Exoplanet Survey Sattelite (TESS) recorded a light curve from a distant star. This was TOI 271.01. The star seemed to have a planet orbiting around it from the light curve data, but this was hard to determine because the star is young and very active. Radial Velocity (RV) exoplanet detection techniques were also unable to pinpoint a mass for a planet that could be orbiting this star. So I created this program to inject different masses (given in multiples of Earth masses) into the RV data to see how big that planet must be before the RV data would be conclusive that a planet exists there. 

I used this program later in a computational physics course for my final project. I created a GIF that shows the relative size of the planet compared to its host star. This GIF is meant to showcase the tell-tale "wobble" that RV exoplanet detection is based on. This means that the presence of a planet around a star causes it to move a little in a tight circle (depending on the relative mass of the planet to the star). The GIF shows the planets orbital path around the star, the relative sizes of the planet and star, and the barycenter. The size of the planet can be changed to show what the effect would be if the planet were larger or smaller using the different masses included in the original project from 2019.
